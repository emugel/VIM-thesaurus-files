VIM thesaurus files
========================================================================
Since VIM only comes with an english thesaurus, and other language thesaurus
files in VIM format aren't always easy to find, here is a simple converter.

It will convert from OpenOffice thes-xx.dat files to VIM-compatible thesaurus
files.

I provided the VIM thesaurus in French already, other languages might be added
later.
